Authorization against LDAP/ActiveDirectory with Java

Simple code for understanding and testing authentication against an LDAP or ActiveDirectory.

Especially the emtpy password issue is worth mentioning - I learned the hard way (see code).

Only the LDAPAuth class contains authentication relevant code - so start there.

Have fun :-)
